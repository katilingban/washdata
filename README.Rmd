This package contains four datasets from an urban water and sanitation survey in Dhaka, Bangladesh conducted by [Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor](https://wsup.com) with technical support from [Valid International](http://www.validinternational.org) in March 2017.

* `popBGD`: Dataset on estimated population of each primary sampling unit (PSU) that were surveyed. This dataset is a mix of data from [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org) for the non-slum areas and from the [2014 Bangladesh Census of Slum Areas and Floating Population](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01wm117r42q).

* `ppiMatrixBGD`: Look-up table for calculating the `Poverty Probability Index` (previously called `Progress out of Poverty Index`) or `PPI` from Bangladesh-specific indicators collected from cross-sectional surveys. This look-up table is extracted from documentation of the `PPI` found at <https://www.povertyindex.org>

* `surveyDataBGD`: Dataset collected through the urban water and sanitation surveys conducted by WSUP in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

* `indicatorsDataBGD`: Dataset produced from `surveyDataBGD` by calculating relevant indicators on water, sanitation and hygiene as specified and defined by WSUP

This survey in Dhaka is one of a series of surveys to be conducted by WSUP in various cities in which they operate including Accra, Ghana; Nakuru, Kenya; Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and, Lusaka, Zambia. This package will be updated once the surveys in other cities are completed and datasets have been made available.
