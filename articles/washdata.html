sanitation for the urban poor<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background-the-global-problem-of-inadequate-access-to-water-and-sanitation-for-the-urban-poor"></a>
</h2>
<p>Over the past two decades most developing countries have experienced
rapid urbanisation as part of a global trend that has brought millions
out of poverty, and helped to bridge the gap between the developed and
the developing world. However, many of the people migrating to urban
environments are concentrated in low-income informal settlements
(commonly referred to as ‘slums’), either within the central city or in
peri-urban districts at the city’s ever-growing periphery. Since 1990,
an estimated 171 million more people are living in such settlements.
This number will only increase over time, with Africa’s urban population
predicted to triple to 1.23 billion people by 2050.</p>
<p>Faced with this trend of mass urban migration, governments and
utilities are proving unable to expand their water and sanitation
systems at sufficient pace to respond to the increasing consumer need.
This is due to a complex web of constraints that characterise the urban
water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector in many developing
countries. These constraints include: limited institutional and
government capacity at the national and city level; lack of technical
expertise to serve low-income areas effectively; lack of the necessary
fiscal and tariff-setting autonomy for mandated service providers to
fulfil their role; unsupportive and/or poorly defined institutional
frameworks; insufficient levels of government investment in water and
sanitation; poorly targeted international financial institutions (IFI)
investments; and weak implementation of existing national policies and
strategies.</p>
<p>Without functional WASH sectors that can deliver new service delivery
models at scale, huge numbers of people living in slums will continue to
remain without access to the most basic services. Diseases related to
inadequate WASH remain among the world’s most serious public health
problems, and the associated impacts on economic productivity and
children’s cognitive development are likely to have profoundly negative
impacts on national development.</p>

<h2 id="water-and-sanitation-for-the-urban-poor-wsup">Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#water-and-sanitation-for-the-urban-poor-wsup"></a>
</h2>
<p>WSUP is a not-for-profit company that helps transform cities to
benefit the millions who lack access to water and sanitation. WSUP
believes that access to safe and affordable water, improved sanitation
and improved hygiene practices underpin poverty reduction through
impacts on health, education and livelihoods. This is coupled with a
conviction in two core principles. Firstly, WSUP believes in the
transformative power of markets and innovation: enormous strides can be
made by bringing the local and international private sector into the
urban WASH space, by driving business thinking in low-income service
provision, and by viewing low-income people as consumers who make
choices. Secondly, WSUP understands that the dynamising power of markets
can only partially solve the problem: deep political commitment,
institutional change, and a functioning WASH sector are equally
critical. Sustainable at-scale progress in urban WASH will only be
achieved if political leaders prioritise government investment and
policy change, and if WASH service providers are assisted to radically
enhance their capacity to deliver effectively on that investment.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.validinternational.org" class="external-link">Valid International
(Valid)</a> is a limited company registered in the UK. The company was
founded by Drs Steve Collins and Alistair Hallam in 1999 to improve the
quality, impact and accountability of global health and nutrition
interventions. <a href="http://www.validinternational.org" class="external-link">Valid</a>
pioneered the Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM)
model for addressing Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) at scale as well as
the local production of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), and was
the central force behind the advocacy leading to the endorsement of the
model by the UN and multiple national governments in 2007. To date, the
approach has been adopted in over 60 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, <a href="http://www.validinternational.org" class="external-link">Valid International</a> has
been the primary provider of technical services for the set-up, training
and monitoring and evaluation of CMAM programmes all over the world. As

<p><a href="http://www.validinternational.org" class="external-link">Valid International</a>’s
assessment arm <strong>Valid Measures</strong> started work 15 years ago
to address the urgent need for a survey method that could accurately
measure the coverage of selective feeding programmes such as CMAM. We
have now developed several innovative approaches for needs assessment
and monitoring and evaluation of the coverage and effectiveness of
nutrition interventions, including the
<code>Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M)</code>,
<code>Rapid Assessment Method (RAM)</code>,
<code>Semi-quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC)</code>,
and
<code>Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SLEAC)</code>.<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAM&lt;/strong&gt; is a quick, simple and low-cost
survey method to assess and monitor individual datasets for multiple
health and nutrition indicators for under-five children, older people
and other vulnerable groups in different humanitarian crises and
development contexts. Compared to other needs assessment and monitoring
methodologies, RAM uses a smaller sample size without compromising
relative precision and spatial distribution, and is therefore ideal for
capturing reliable data for different vulnerable groups, including
socio-cultural sub-populations, in a timely and cost-efficient manner.
&lt;strong&gt;S3M&lt;/strong&gt; is a development of the Centric Systematic Area
Sampling (CSAS) method providing better spatial resolution with lower
sampling costs. S3M is appropriate for mapping coverage (or prevalence
of indicators) over very wide-areas. &lt;strong&gt;SQUEAC&lt;/strong&gt; is a
semi-quantitative method that provides in-depth analysis of barriers and
boosters to coverage. It is designed as a routine program monitoring
tool through the intelligent use of routine monitoring data complemented
by other relevant data that are collected on a “little and often” basis.
&lt;strong&gt;SLEAC&lt;/strong&gt; is a rapid low-resource survey method that
classifies coverage at the service delivery unit (SDU) level such as the
district. A SLEAC survey identifies the category of coverage (e.g. “low
coverage”, “moderate coverage” or “high coverage”) that describes the
coverage of the service delivery unit being assessed. The advantage of
this approach is that relatively small sample sizes (e.g. &lt;span class="math inline"&gt;\(n ≤ 40\)&lt;/span&gt;) are required in order to make an
accurate and reliable classification.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>3</sup></a> Taken
together, these approaches have improved assessment outputs over the
standard cluster sample approach used in health and nutrition surveys,
including improved precision of results, speed of data collection,
understanding of barriers and boosters to service access, spatially even
distribution of data collection, and detailed spatial mapping of
indicator results.</p>
<p>Whist this work was initially focussed on the measurement of coverage
of feeding interventions it has now expanded to assess multiple
indicator sets, making the methodologies suitable for evaluation of a
broad range of multi-sectoral interventions and practices including the
assessment of WASH indicators.</p>

<h2 id="background-to-the-citywide-surveys">Background to the citywide surveys<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#background-to-the-citywide-surveys"></a>
</h2>
<p>In order to measure sustained universal coverage in urban areas of
WSUP programme countries<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and
Zambia&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>4</sup></a>, WSUP will be conducting citywide surveys
in one selected city for each of our six programme countries in early
2017 and early 2020. These citywide surveys will collect data allowing
service levels across the entire city to be characterised, while also
allowing more detailed data to be collected in areas of the city of
particular interest to WSUP. These surveys are intended to generate
useful information for others working in the sector including the
municipality, regulator and local utilities.</p>
<p>In support of these citywide surveys, <a href="http://www.validinternational.org" class="external-link">Valid International</a> has
been contracted to provide technical support with the design of the
citywide surveys, with particular focus on the technical design of
variable density sampling approaches that enable a general
characterisation of the entire city, while allowing higher-resolution
data to be obtained in areas of specific WSUP interest. This should be
achieved while minimising the sample size as far as possible provided
that it retains the ability to generate statistically significant
conclusions.</p>

considerations<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#wsup-information-requirements-and-other-survey-design-considerations"></a>
</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>WSUP would like to be able to report findings that are
representative for three specific populations of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>The general city-wide population;</li>
<li>Low income/poor population within the city; and,</li>
<li>WSUP-identified population of interest<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Main consideration for selecting population of interest
is living in areas within the city where WSUP is currently providing
interventions or supporting projects&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>5</sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As such, the design will ideally have 3 sampling frames (one for each
population of interest) with each having their own sample size
requirement so as to be able to report estimates of the various water
and sanitation indicators. The sample size requirement (see section on
sample size) in each sampling frame would be the same so at the minimum,
this approach will require triple the sample size from doing a survey of
only one population of interest.</p>
<p>The specified populations of interest also provide some challenges
that need to be considered when designing the survey. These challenges
pertain to identification of these populations and determining where
they can be located or found within the city. For low income/poor
populations, the first issue to address is who to consider as having
low-income or as being poor given that there are a multitude of concepts
and metrics used to define this categorisation (e.g., income-based,
asset-based, multi-dimensional poverty, etc.) and varying levels of
available data that can provide information to determine who is low
income/poor. In addition to knowing who is to be considered low income
or poor, it would be important to know which areas of the selected city
are considered low income / poor areas. Ideally, this should be
presented in a map of the city indicating generally (or specifically)
where areas of low income / poverty can be located. This can usually be
done using map outputs of work done by other researchers on poverty
mapping. However, most of this work on poverty mapping have results of
low resolution (i.e., poverty is mapped down to district level only) and
rarely present poverty mapping at smaller units of a city.</p>
<p>As for WSUP-identified populations of interest specifically
populations who live in areas within the city where WSUP provides
interventions, the challenges are similar in identifying who these
populations are and determining the area in the city where they can be
located. Whilst locating the general areas where beneficiaries of WSUP
interventions live can be relatively simple, knowing the full and
specific extent of where they are located in the city can be difficult
given that they may not necessarily fall neatly into known
administrative units/boundaries.</p>
<p>An additional issue with having a focus on WSUP-supported areas is
that it has additional sample size requirements especially if the
purpose of drilling down on these focused areas is to report on
experience and satisfaction of users of WSUP services and interventions
(which is what is indicated in our preliminary review of the
questionnaire) specifically. We think that to get such information
requires a different approach to data collection and cannot be easily
nested within a bigger cross- sectional requirements without
complicating the whole process with .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The type of indicators that WSUP would like to assess through the
survey and the questionnaire that is to be used to collect information
to calculate these indicators will also influence to some extent the
design of the survey. Hence, they are factors to consider at design
phase.</p>
<p>From the current questionnaire that we have seen, the target
respondent of the survey are households with the head of the household
present during survey time as the key person of interest to provide
answers to the questions. So, this is primarily a household survey.</p>
<p>Within the questionnaire, some form of household roster is documented
such that the head of the household is asked about the other members of
the household and specifically their ages and/or their age groupings,
their gender and other specific categorisation / groupings of interest
such as persons with disability, pregnant women<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;It is interesting to note that based on the WSUP
questionnaires, pregnant women are identified separately but are
classified within the grouping of those with disability&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>6</sup></a>, and in some cases
persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). This is not a standard household
roster per se as the data collected on the members of the household are
still attributed to the household itself (the data on the members are
individual variables on the household data itself) rather than a
separate data branch from the household data (which is what is typical
of a household roster). From our review, it seems that the data from
household members are used to report indicator results of access and
coverage to water and sanitation services specific to the different
categories of interest. Such kind of reporting has sample size
implications but as of yet it is not clear whether this is indeed what
the purpose of the household roster is. So, for the purpose of this
design document, we focus on the idea that this survey is targeting
households and reporting results on households only rather than
different categories of interest to which members of the household
belong to.</p>
<p>The questionnaire also indicate that most likely majority of the
indicators that WSUP needs to be reported are proportion-type of
indicators and mostly based on respondents’ self-report with most
questions requiring a yes/no answer whilst some require responding based
on a scale<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;The questionnaire uses a 4 category scale i.e.,
satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, dissatisfied&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>7</sup></a> which are used for eliciting satisfaction
from services that accessed and/or provided. The questionnaire doesn’t
require measurements to obtain data (numerical data) but a module on
poverty assessment<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;WSUP uses the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI)&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>8</sup></a> uses a numeric scoring scale to
produced/report an index score for a household that is then used to
assess the level of wealth/poverty of the household. Given that majority
of the indicators are proportion- type, sample size calculations will
take this into account.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that by nature, indicators on access to
water and sanitation services are highly clustered. That is, source of
drinking water or type of sanitation facility tend to be delivered or
provided in a similar way among groups or sets of households
specifically those living within a block or a neighbourhood. Hence,
responses taken from households that live near each other or on the same
street or neighbourhood will most likely be similar if not totally
identical. This is the nature of a water and sanitation questionnaire
and their associated indicators in a cross-sectional survey and should
be factored in when estimating sample size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WSUP would like to have as much spatial disaggregation of the
results across the city as possible as this will provide more nuanced
information for the organisation with regard to variances in service
provision and access throughout the city which can in turn help guide
programme development, beneficiary targeting and programme
implementation. At the minimum, WSUP would like to be able to report
results specific to the three main populations of interest mentioned
above and ideally have an even finer breakdown of results across the
low-income/poor groupings and the WSUP-supported communities.</p>
<p>This requirement has implications on the sample size (both overall
and at each level of disaggregation) hence should be taken into account.
The general rule is, the finer the resolution of results needed, the
higher the sample size required.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="survey-design">Survey design<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#survey-design"></a>
</h2>
<p>Based on the considerations discussed above, we propose the following
overall design that can be applicable to all of the six countries that
WSUP plans to survey.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sample-universe">Sample Universe<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sample-universe"></a>
</h3>
<p>The survey is to take place at household level. There are three
populations to be surveyed:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A representative sample from across all of the city, to estimate
WASH services coverage (e.g. indicators like percentage of the
population using an improved, non-shared sanitation facility)</p></li>
<li><p>A representative sample from identified low-income/poor areas of
the city, assessing the same indicators</p></li>
<li><p>A representative sample from one or more WSUP-identified areas of
interest, either for previous work locations or proposed future
locations, again assessing the same indicators</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sample-frame">Sample frame<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sample-frame"></a>
</h3>
<p>We propose a sampling frame with at least three levels of spatial
stratification across the city and a two-stage spatial sampling design
within each of the spatial strata.</p>
<p>The three levels of spatial stratification that we propose are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>A first level sub-division of the city – this would usually be a
formally recognised and/or official sub-division of the city along known
or set administrative boundaries. However, it should be noted that
formally recognised and/or official sub-divisions of a city may or may
not always include urban sprawl or peri-urban areas or conurbations that
extend the city.</p>
<p>These areas are usually a result of influx of people from rural areas
and other areas of the country to the city who form communities around
the borders of the city and/or in specific areas within the city. The
people who form these communities tend to be low-income/poor. Hence, it
would be important that further investigation be made whether formally
recognised borders of the city include these conurbations and are part
of the first level sub- divisions of the city that will be used for the
sampling. If they are not, then a decision has to be made whether the
areas that have not been included fall under WSUP’s other populations of
interest such as the low-income/poor (category b above) and/or those
that receive or benefit from WSUP interventions (category c above). If
these areas are deemed important to include in the sample universe, then
these areas are added to the sample universe either as a separate
sub-division within the city<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;In some cities, these settlements are categorised or
named as slums or squatters areas and can be formally or informally
recognised by authorities and/or city planners&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>9</sup></a> or included within the existing
sub-divisions of the city.</p>
<p>The rationale for having this first level of stratification is to
serve as a unit of disaggregation to which the survey will be designed
to be able to report indicator estimates on. This, therefore, has an
impact on sample size as the more the first level sub-divisions there
are, the higher the overall sample size needed (see sample size section
for detail). This would mean that in some cases for cities with numerous
first-level sub-divisions, some kind of grouping of first-level
sub-divisions would be necessary so as balance the need for spatial
disaggregation of results with the level of resources available for the
surveys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A second grouping based on low-income/poor stratification – this
would address WSUP’s requirement of reporting results specific to the
low-income/poor population of the city. In this section, we refer to
low-income/poor stratification as a geographical grouping based on areas
that are known to be low-income/poor. This information should be based
on known or established concepts of low-income/poor which have been
mapped and areas and boundaries of which are well-defined. These maybe
available for some cities (as described in the section on design
considerations).</p>
<p>It is possible that the first level sub-division stratification
described in point 1 above overlaps with the second stratification on
low-income/poor. As mentioned, there maybe specific first level
sub-divisions that include certain first level units being classified or
categorised as low-income/poor<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Especially true if the mapping of the low-income/poor
areas are fixed specifically on administrative boundaries and not at
more localised areas&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>10</sup></a>. If so, then the first level and second
level stratification proposed here will be the same as it already
includes a grouping based on low-income/poor status. On the other hand,
these areas can be smaller units interspersed across the first level
sub-divisions (i.e., slums). In this case, we will need to define these
areas separately as a second-level sub-division within the first-level
units.</p>
<p>It is also important to clarify that this stratification on
low-income/poor does not necessarily imply that all respondents within
areas that are considered low-income/poor are indeed low- income/poor
(based on actual metrics of poverty such as wealth index, etc.) and the
same for areas that are classified as not low-income/poor. Variations in
wealth status at the household level can still vary within these areas
and this variation will be captured through the survey itself. What this
geographical stratification on the basis of low-income/poor does is it
allows us to provide a specific sampling frame and hence a specific
dataset for this area to be able to provide more robust disaggregated
spatial results. This is based on the recognition that these areas of
low-income/poor have more likely very different characteristics compared
to the more formal and organised areas that are not considered
low-income/poor. Such characteristics (e.g., housing structure,
available services, etc) would make these areas function in a different
way than others and the households within them live in a different way
than other households in other areas. Capturing this variation specific
to this area would therefore be important particularly in an
urban-setting survey where clustering is very common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third grouping are WSUP-identified areas of interest either
based on previous work locations or proposed future locations. These are
even more localised areas and are often not clearly delineated
geographically. This will require work to delineate and map these areas
as clearly as possible so that they can server as third level
sub-divisions with their own sampling frame.</p>
<p>It should be noted that this third-level of sub-division will require
additional sample size which should be considered weighing in the
desirability of having results specific to WSUP-identified areas of
interest with resources available.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these levels of spatial stratification will have their own
sampling frames and as such will require their own sample sizes.</p>

<p>The following sample size calculations are for each spatial strata
described above which will address WSUP’s requirements for spatially
disaggregated results based on defined sets of populations to report
on.</p>
<p><strong>Sample size for estimating proportion-type
indicators</strong> Based on the nature of the indicators that WSUP
requires the survey to report on, the sample size calculations should be
powered to be able to report proportion-type of estimates. In addition,
sample size required for the survey depends on:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><code>Precision</code> of the estimate required (as determined by
the width of the confidence interval around the estimates);
and,</p></li>
<li><p><code>Variance inflating factor (VIF)</code> or
<code>design effect (DEFF)</code> for the chosen design (e.g., simple
random sample, cluster sample, etc.), reflecting the increase in sample
required to use a cluster design. The general formula to calculate
sample sizes to estimate a proportion (sometimes called prevalence)
indicator is:</p></li>
</ol>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ n = z ^ 2 \times{\frac{p(1-p)}{c ^ 2}}
\]</span> <br></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n = \text{sample size}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(z = \text{z-value for} ~ 95\% ~
\text{confidence interval}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p = \text{expected
proportion/prevalence}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c = \text{level of
precision}\)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>To be able to use this formula, we set out the following parameters
specific to the survey requirements and the sample frame described
above:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(z = 1.96 ~ \text{(for} ~ 95\% ~
\text{CI)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(p = 50\% ~ \text{(assume proportion
requiring highest sample size)}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c = 0.10 ~ \text{(} 10\% ~
\text{precision)}\)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This gives us the following sample size:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ n = 1.96 ^ 2 \times{\frac{0.5(1 -
0.5)}{0.1 ^ 2}} \approx 96 \]</span> <br></p>
<p>We therefore need a sample size of <span class="math inline">\(n =
96\)</span> assuming a simple random sample survey design.</p>
<p>However, given that we will be using a clustered sample design, we
need to take into consideration design effect or <code>DEFF</code>.
<code>DEFF</code> is related to the indicators being studied as well as
the planned sample size per cluster, and is best calculated empirically
from previous similar surveys in the area being studied. The best
reference survey to use to estimate <code>DEFF</code> from is the
<strong>Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)</strong> which is conducted
every 5 years in most countries. In general, DHS includes an urban
sample from the capital city and from other main cities of the country
which can be used to estimate the
<code>intra-cluster coefficient (ICC)</code>. The
<code>intra-cluster coefficient</code> gives an estimate of how
correlated the responses are for specific questions / indicators within
a cluster thereby providing a metric for the loss of variance as a
function of the cluster survey sample design. The purpose of
<code>DEFF</code> is to inflate the base sample size based on a simple
random sample design so as to increase the variance of the survey
sample. This counteracts the clustering that happens with a cluster
sample design and that is created by the type of indicators being
surveyed (such as water and sanitation indicators). <code>DEFF</code>
can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ DEFF = 1 + (c - 1) \times \rho
\]</span> <br></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(c = \text{cluster size}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\rho = \text{intracluster coefficient
(ICC)}\)</span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>This equation shows that <code>DEFF</code> increases with increases
in cluster size and/or in <code>ICC</code>. Since there is very little
we can do to change <code>ICC</code>, the general idea will be to reduce
cluster size as much as possible as this will bring down
<code>DEFF</code>. The smaller the cluster size, the more that the
survey design approximates a simple random sample.</p>
<p>Studies that have estimated <code>DEFF</code> using survey datasets
from various countries have shown that <code>DEFF</code> for water and
sanitation indicators can range from as low as 1.5 to as high as 7.
<code>DEFF</code> should therefore be estimated per country whenever
possible so that a more precise sample size estimate can be
calculated.</p>
<p>Once <code>DEFF</code> has been estimated, the base sample size of
<span class="math inline">\(n = 96\)</span> can be adjusted as
follows:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ n_{adjusted} = n_{base} \times DEFF =
96 \times DEFF \]</span> <br></p>
<p><strong>Sample size for classifying proportion indicators</strong>
Another way of reporting proportion indicators is by classification,
that is determining whether a certain threshold or thresholds is/are
reached by the results of the indicator enabling its categorisation into
specific classes of achievement (i.e., high or low, success or failure,
adequate or inadequate). The approach of classification is called
<code>lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)</code> which is an
analytical technique developed and used widely in the industrial field
(pharmaceuticals, manufacturing to name a few) as an efficient and
cost-effective way of checking and controlling the quality of voluminous
products manufactured<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;See Lanata, C.F. &amp;amp; Black, R.E., 1991. Lot quality
assurance sampling techniques in health surveys in developing countries:
advantages and current constraints. World Health Statistics Quarterly,
44(3), pp.133–139&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>11</sup></a>. <code>LQAS</code> requires much smaller
sample size than the classical estimation approach mainly because of the
type of information it provides (classification rather than estimation).
From a quality control perspective particularly at an industrial level,
a classification result determining whether a specific lot or set of
goods produced are of good quality or not is just the information needed
to be able to make decisions on whether or not to release the lot of
goods to the market and whether an inspection of a specific production
line needs to be performed to check its manufacturing process. Such
decision-making do not require results of high precision. For example,
if a drug company sets its quality control standard at <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span> of medicine in a batch produced
meets the quality requirements, then a survey with a sample size aimed
at reporting an estimate with acceptable precision (as described above)
that gives an estimate of 60% has the same decision-making value as a
survey using a much smaller sample size (usually <span class="math inline">\(n = 40\)</span>) that classifies the batch of
medicines as failure (below <span class="math inline">\(80\%\)</span>).
Both sets of result will guide plant managers in determining that the
specific batch of medicines are of poor quality hence should not be
brought to market. However, the <code>LQAS</code> approach provides this
information with about half of the sample size.</p>
<p>The use of this quality control technique has been adapted for use in
health monitoring and health surveys, which include water and sanitation
indicators, to a great degree because of its small sample size
requirements<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;See Lanata, C.F. et al., 1988. Lot quality assurance
sampling in health monitoring. The Lancet, 1(8577), pp.122–123 and
Robertson, S.E. &amp;amp; Valadez, J.J., 2006. Global review of health care
surveys using lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS), 1984– 2004. Social
Science &amp;amp; Medicine, 63(6), pp.1648–1660.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>12</sup></a> which lends itself well to routine and
repeated applications over time and location.</p>
<p><code>LQAS</code> generally requires a sample size of <span class="math inline">\(n = 40\)</span> . Adjustments to this sample size
are made based on survey design and the cut-offs used for classifying
with a cut-off of <span class="math inline">\(50\%\)</span> requiring
the highest sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n = 40\)</span>).
Factoring cluster design, this minimum sample size can go up to <span class="math inline">\(n = 60\)</span> which is the typical sample size
used for <code>LQAS</code> applied to water and sanitation indicators<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Based on previous work done by Valid International on

</h3>
<p>Stage 1 sampling is the the selection of clusters or
<code>primary sampling units (PSU)</code> in which the sample of
households will be collected from. We propose to select survey clusters
using a variable grid spatial sampling approach. Cluster locations will
be chosen for each sampling frame (non-slum, slum, and operational area)
using <code>centric systematic area sampling (CSAS)</code>. This will be
performed through the following general steps<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;Some modifications to these steps may need to be done
on a country by country basis particularly with regard to how the
groupings of the spatial units are organised and sub-divided. Otherwise,
the general approach is the same on any setting.&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>14</sup></a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<p>Get appropriate maps for the city to be surveyed. The types of
maps that will be appropriate for this urban sampling approach are:</p>

<li><p>Map data files<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content="&lt;p&gt;There are many formats for map files. In general, the
most common and most accessible formats are keyhole markup language

whole city and each of the three levels of the sampling frame<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-bs-toggle="popover" data-bs-content='&lt;p&gt;These days,there are various available online
repositories of map data files for most countries including cities. We
most commonly use the repository maintained by Robert Hijmans at &lt;a href="https://gadm.org" class="external-link uri"&gt;https://gadm.org&lt;/a&gt; and the one
maintained by UN OCHA called Humanitarian Data Exchange (&lt;a href="https://data.humdata.org" class="external-link uri"&gt;https://data.humdata.org&lt;/a&gt;). Organisations such as the
World Food Programme also maintain their own repositories but most of
their maps are also made available through the Humanitarian Data
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>16</sup></a>;</p></li>

used to view satellite imagery of the city.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>18</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Using maps with boundaries of the different administrative levels
with an overlay of the high resolution gridded population maps, draw a
square grid around each spatial strata that has been identified for the
city. The size of the grid will be dependent on the number of sampling
clusters that has been decided when calculating sample size. The grid
should cover only areas with populations as indicated by the population
maps.</p></li>
<li><p>Get the centroid of each quadrat (square) of the grid. This
identifies the primary sampling unit within the specified area where the
stage 2 sampling will be conducted. The geographical coordinates of the
centroid will be captured and recorded and put on the stage 1 sampling
list (and drawn on appropriate maps) for enumerators to use during data
collection.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It should be noted that the stage 1 sample is not selected
<code>proportional to population size (PPS)</code> which is a stage 1
sample selection approach that is commonly used in most population
surveys. Instead the stage 1 sample is drawn spatially through an even
square grid across the city. This approach addresses the limitation of a
<code>PPS</code> sample which gives a cluster with higher population a
higher probability of being included in the sample compared to clusters
with smaller populations. Also, a population-weighted stage 1 sample is
drawn from a specific sampling frame hence can only be representative of
that frame. Any form of disaggregation of that dataset to provide
results at finer resolution will not be possible to perform.</p>
<p>For the spatial sampling approach, the dataset can be disaggregated
and aggregated accordingly by just applying a cluster weighting approach
(using the population at each cluster as the weights) used in analysis
of stratified data in estimating the indicators of interest. This is
what is called posterior weighting approach. Population estimates
obtained from WorldPop remote sensing data can be used for the purpose
of weighting the cluster data.</p>

<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="sampling-stage-2">Sampling Stage 2<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#sampling-stage-2"></a>
</h3>
<p>At each cluster, a total of two households will be selected. The
cluster will be identified using GPS coordinates on enumerators’
devices, and the start household will be identified as the building
closest to the GPS coordinates. In the case of a multi-household or
apartment building, the household will be chosen randomly. To select the
second household, we recommend a general approach of choosing from the
building or housing structure five doors to the right facing the door of
the start household.</p>
<p>It is very likely that the spatial organisation of the various cities
to be sampled will be different between each other. Also, within each
city, there will be differences in the setting and organisation of
buildings and houses in different parts of the city which will require
adjustments or variations to the general approach for stage 2 sampling
described above specifically for selecting the second household. This is
something that will require investigation and testing prior to the start
of the survey in every city and experiences documented in the process
document produced during and after the survey process. This will help in
producing more nuanced guidelines on other approaches to stage 2
sampling.</p>
