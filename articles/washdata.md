# Urban Water and Sanitation Survey Dataset

## Background: the global problem of inadequate access to water and sanitation for the urban poor

Over the past two decades most developing countries have experienced
rapid urbanisation as part of a global trend that has brought millions
out of poverty, and helped to bridge the gap between the developed and
the developing world. However, many of the people migrating to urban
environments are concentrated in low-income informal settlements
(commonly referred to as ‘slums’), either within the central city or in
peri-urban districts at the city’s ever-growing periphery. Since 1990,
an estimated 171 million more people are living in such settlements.
This number will only increase over time, with Africa’s urban population
predicted to triple to 1.23 billion people by 2050.

Faced with this trend of mass urban migration, governments and utilities
are proving unable to expand their water and sanitation systems at
sufficient pace to respond to the increasing consumer need. This is due
to a complex web of constraints that characterise the urban water,
sanitation and hygiene (WASH) sector in many developing countries. These
constraints include: limited institutional and government capacity at
the national and city level; lack of technical expertise to serve
low-income areas effectively; lack of the necessary fiscal and
tariff-setting autonomy for mandated service providers to fulfil their
role; unsupportive and/or poorly defined institutional frameworks;
insufficient levels of government investment in water and sanitation;
poorly targeted international financial institutions (IFI) investments;
and weak implementation of existing national policies and strategies.

Without functional WASH sectors that can deliver new service delivery
models at scale, huge numbers of people living in slums will continue to
remain without access to the most basic services. Diseases related to
inadequate WASH remain among the world’s most serious public health
problems, and the associated impacts on economic productivity and
children’s cognitive development are likely to have profoundly negative
impacts on national development.

## Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor (WSUP)

WSUP is a not-for-profit company that helps transform cities to benefit
the millions who lack access to water and sanitation. WSUP believes that
access to safe and affordable water, improved sanitation and improved
hygiene practices underpin poverty reduction through impacts on health,
education and livelihoods. This is coupled with a conviction in two core
principles. Firstly, WSUP believes in the transformative power of
markets and innovation: enormous strides can be made by bringing the
local and international private sector into the urban WASH space, by
driving business thinking in low-income service provision, and by
viewing low-income people as consumers who make choices. Secondly, WSUP
understands that the dynamising power of markets can only partially
solve the problem: deep political commitment, institutional change, and
a functioning WASH sector are equally critical. Sustainable at-scale
progress in urban WASH will only be achieved if political leaders
prioritise government investment and policy change, and if WASH service
providers are assisted to radically enhance their capacity to deliver
effectively on that investment.

## Valid International

Valid International (Valid) is a limited company registered in the UK.
The company was founded by Drs Steve Collins and Alistair Hallam in 1999
to improve the quality, impact and accountability of global health and
nutrition interventions. Valid pioneered the Community-based Management
of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) model for addressing Severe Acute
Malnutrition (SAM) at scale as well as the local production of Ready to
Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF), and was the central force behind the
advocacy leading to the endorsement of the model by the UN and multiple
national governments in 2007. To date, the approach has been adopted in
over 60 countries worldwide.

Over the past ten years, Valid International has been the primary
provider of technical services for the set-up, training and monitoring
and evaluation of CMAM programmes all over the world. As part of this,
Valid International has developed various tools and methods that
facilitate the provision of these services. For CMAM setup and training,
Valid has published a field manual for CMAM[¹](#fn1) that gives detailed
guidance for the set up and implementation of CMAM. In addition, Valid
has supported the development of CMAM training modules with support and
funding from FANTA[²](#fn2).

Valid International’s assessment arm **Valid Measures** started work 15
years ago to address the urgent need for a survey method that could
accurately measure the coverage of selective feeding programmes such as
CMAM. We have now developed several innovative approaches for needs
assessment and monitoring and evaluation of the coverage and
effectiveness of nutrition interventions, including the
`Simple Spatial Survey Method (S3M)`, `Rapid Assessment Method (RAM)`,
`Semi-quantitative Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SQUEAC)`, and
`Simplified Lot Quality Assurance Sampling Evaluation of Access and Coverage (SLEAC)`.[³](#fn3)
Taken together, these approaches have improved assessment outputs over
the standard cluster sample approach used in health and nutrition
surveys, including improved precision of results, speed of data
collection, understanding of barriers and boosters to service access,
spatially even distribution of data collection, and detailed spatial
mapping of indicator results.

Whist this work was initially focussed on the measurement of coverage of
feeding interventions it has now expanded to assess multiple indicator
sets, making the methodologies suitable for evaluation of a broad range
of multi-sectoral interventions and practices including the assessment
of WASH indicators.

## Background to the citywide surveys

In order to measure sustained universal coverage in urban areas of WSUP
programme countries[⁴](#fn4), WSUP will be conducting citywide surveys
in one selected city for each of our six programme countries in early
2017 and early 2020. These citywide surveys will collect data allowing
service levels across the entire city to be characterised, while also
allowing more detailed data to be collected in areas of the city of
particular interest to WSUP. These surveys are intended to generate
useful information for others working in the sector including the
municipality, regulator and local utilities.

In support of these citywide surveys, Valid International has been
contracted to provide technical support with the design of the citywide
surveys, with particular focus on the technical design of variable
density sampling approaches that enable a general characterisation of
the entire city, while allowing higher-resolution data to be obtained in
areas of specific WSUP interest. This should be achieved while
minimising the sample size as far as possible provided that it retains
the ability to generate statistically significant conclusions.

## WSUP information requirements and other survey design considerations

1.  WSUP would like to be able to report findings that are
    representative for three specific populations of interest:

    - The general city-wide population;
    - Low income/poor population within the city; and,
    - WSUP-identified population of interest[⁵](#fn5).

    As such, the design will ideally have 3 sampling frames (one for
    each population of interest) with each having their own sample size
    requirement so as to be able to report estimates of the various
    water and sanitation indicators. The sample size requirement (see
    section on sample size) in each sampling frame would be the same so
    at the minimum, this approach will require triple the sample size
    from doing a survey of only one population of interest.

    The specified populations of interest also provide some challenges
    that need to be considered when designing the survey. These
    challenges pertain to identification of these populations and
    determining where they can be located or found within the city. For
    low income/poor populations, the first issue to address is who to
    consider as having low-income or as being poor given that there are
    a multitude of concepts and metrics used to define this
    categorisation (e.g., income-based, asset-based, multi-dimensional
    poverty, etc.) and varying levels of available data that can provide
    information to determine who is low income/poor. In addition to
    knowing who is to be considered low income or poor, it would be
    important to know which areas of the selected city are considered
    low income / poor areas. Ideally, this should be presented in a map
    of the city indicating generally (or specifically) where areas of
    low income / poverty can be located. This can usually be done using
    map outputs of work done by other researchers on poverty mapping.
    However, most of this work on poverty mapping have results of low
    resolution (i.e., poverty is mapped down to district level only) and
    rarely present poverty mapping at smaller units of a city.

    As for WSUP-identified populations of interest specifically
    populations who live in areas within the city where WSUP provides
    interventions, the challenges are similar in identifying who these
    populations are and determining the area in the city where they can
    be located. Whilst locating the general areas where beneficiaries of
    WSUP interventions live can be relatively simple, knowing the full
    and specific extent of where they are located in the city can be
    difficult given that they may not necessarily fall neatly into known
    administrative units/boundaries.

    An additional issue with having a focus on WSUP-supported areas is
    that it has additional sample size requirements especially if the
    purpose of drilling down on these focused areas is to report on
    experience and satisfaction of users of WSUP services and
    interventions (which is what is indicated in our preliminary review
    of the questionnaire) specifically. We think that to get such
    information requires a different approach to data collection and
    cannot be easily nested within a bigger cross- sectional
    requirements without complicating the whole process with .

2.  The type of indicators that WSUP would like to assess through the
    survey and the questionnaire that is to be used to collect
    information to calculate these indicators will also influence to
    some extent the design of the survey. Hence, they are factors to
    consider at design phase.

    From the current questionnaire that we have seen, the target
    respondent of the survey are households with the head of the
    household present during survey time as the key person of interest
    to provide answers to the questions. So, this is primarily a
    household survey.

    Within the questionnaire, some form of household roster is
    documented such that the head of the household is asked about the
    other members of the household and specifically their ages and/or
    their age groupings, their gender and other specific categorisation
    / groupings of interest such as persons with disability, pregnant
    women[⁶](#fn6), and in some cases persons living with HIV/AIDS
    (PLWHA). This is not a standard household roster per se as the data
    collected on the members of the household are still attributed to
    the household itself (the data on the members are individual
    variables on the household data itself) rather than a separate data
    branch from the household data (which is what is typical of a
    household roster). From our review, it seems that the data from
    household members are used to report indicator results of access and
    coverage to water and sanitation services specific to the different
    categories of interest. Such kind of reporting has sample size
    implications but as of yet it is not clear whether this is indeed
    what the purpose of the household roster is. So, for the purpose of
    this design document, we focus on the idea that this survey is
    targeting households and reporting results on households only rather
    than different categories of interest to which members of the
    household belong to.

    The questionnaire also indicate that most likely majority of the
    indicators that WSUP needs to be reported are proportion-type of
    indicators and mostly based on respondents’ self-report with most
    questions requiring a yes/no answer whilst some require responding
    based on a scale[⁷](#fn7) which are used for eliciting satisfaction
    from services that accessed and/or provided. The questionnaire
    doesn’t require measurements to obtain data (numerical data) but a
    module on poverty assessment[⁸](#fn8) uses a numeric scoring scale
    to produced/report an index score for a household that is then used
    to assess the level of wealth/poverty of the household. Given that
    majority of the indicators are proportion- type, sample size
    calculations will take this into account.

    Finally, it should be noted that by nature, indicators on access to
    water and sanitation services are highly clustered. That is, source
    of drinking water or type of sanitation facility tend to be
    delivered or provided in a similar way among groups or sets of
    households specifically those living within a block or a
    neighbourhood. Hence, responses taken from households that live near
    each other or on the same street or neighbourhood will most likely
    be similar if not totally identical. This is the nature of a water
    and sanitation questionnaire and their associated indicators in a
    cross-sectional survey and should be factored in when estimating
    sample size.

3.  WSUP would like to have as much spatial disaggregation of the
    results across the city as possible as this will provide more
    nuanced information for the organisation with regard to variances in
    service provision and access throughout the city which can in turn
    help guide programme development, beneficiary targeting and
    programme implementation. At the minimum, WSUP would like to be able
    to report results specific to the three main populations of interest
    mentioned above and ideally have an even finer breakdown of results
    across the low-income/poor groupings and the WSUP-supported
    communities.

    This requirement has implications on the sample size (both overall
    and at each level of disaggregation) hence should be taken into
    account. The general rule is, the finer the resolution of results
    needed, the higher the sample size required.

## Survey design

Based on the considerations discussed above, we propose the following
overall design that can be applicable to all of the six countries that
WSUP plans to survey.

### Sample Universe

The survey is to take place at household level. There are three
populations to be surveyed:

- A representative sample from across all of the city, to estimate WASH
  services coverage (e.g. indicators like percentage of the population
  using an improved, non-shared sanitation facility)

- A representative sample from identified low-income/poor areas of the
  city, assessing the same indicators

- A representative sample from one or more WSUP-identified areas of
  interest, either for previous work locations or proposed future
  locations, again assessing the same indicators

### Sample frame

We propose a sampling frame with at least three levels of spatial
stratification across the city and a two-stage spatial sampling design
within each of the spatial strata.

The three levels of spatial stratification that we propose are:

1.  A first level sub-division of the city – this would usually be a
    formally recognised and/or official sub-division of the city along
    known or set administrative boundaries. However, it should be noted
    that formally recognised and/or official sub-divisions of a city may
    or may not always include urban sprawl or peri-urban areas or
    conurbations that extend the city.

    These areas are usually a result of influx of people from rural
    areas and other areas of the country to the city who form
    communities around the borders of the city and/or in specific areas
    within the city. The people who form these communities tend to be
    low-income/poor. Hence, it would be important that further
    investigation be made whether formally recognised borders of the
    city include these conurbations and are part of the first level sub-
    divisions of the city that will be used for the sampling. If they
    are not, then a decision has to be made whether the areas that have
    not been included fall under WSUP’s other populations of interest
    such as the low-income/poor (category b above) and/or those that
    receive or benefit from WSUP interventions (category c above). If
    these areas are deemed important to include in the sample universe,
    then these areas are added to the sample universe either as a
    separate sub-division within the city[⁹](#fn9) or included within
    the existing sub-divisions of the city.

    The rationale for having this first level of stratification is to
    serve as a unit of disaggregation to which the survey will be
    designed to be able to report indicator estimates on. This,
    therefore, has an impact on sample size as the more the first level
    sub-divisions there are, the higher the overall sample size needed
    (see sample size section for detail). This would mean that in some
    cases for cities with numerous first-level sub-divisions, some kind
    of grouping of first-level sub-divisions would be necessary so as
    balance the need for spatial disaggregation of results with the
    level of resources available for the surveys.

2.  A second grouping based on low-income/poor stratification – this
    would address WSUP’s requirement of reporting results specific to
    the low-income/poor population of the city. In this section, we
    refer to low-income/poor stratification as a geographical grouping
    based on areas that are known to be low-income/poor. This
    information should be based on known or established concepts of
    low-income/poor which have been mapped and areas and boundaries of
    which are well-defined. These maybe available for some cities (as
    described in the section on design considerations).

    It is possible that the first level sub-division stratification
    described in point 1 above overlaps with the second stratification
    on low-income/poor. As mentioned, there maybe specific first level
    sub-divisions that include certain first level units being
    classified or categorised as low-income/poor[¹⁰](#fn10). If so, then
    the first level and second level stratification proposed here will
    be the same as it already includes a grouping based on
    low-income/poor status. On the other hand, these areas can be
    smaller units interspersed across the first level sub-divisions
    (i.e., slums). In this case, we will need to define these areas
    separately as a second-level sub-division within the first-level
    units.

    It is also important to clarify that this stratification on
    low-income/poor does not necessarily imply that all respondents
    within areas that are considered low-income/poor are indeed low-
    income/poor (based on actual metrics of poverty such as wealth
    index, etc.) and the same for areas that are classified as not
    low-income/poor. Variations in wealth status at the household level
    can still vary within these areas and this variation will be
    captured through the survey itself. What this geographical
    stratification on the basis of low-income/poor does is it allows us
    to provide a specific sampling frame and hence a specific dataset
    for this area to be able to provide more robust disaggregated
    spatial results. This is based on the recognition that these areas
    of low-income/poor have more likely very different characteristics
    compared to the more formal and organised areas that are not
    considered low-income/poor. Such characteristics (e.g., housing
    structure, available services, etc) would make these areas function
    in a different way than others and the households within them live
    in a different way than other households in other areas. Capturing
    this variation specific to this area would therefore be important
    particularly in an urban-setting survey where clustering is very
    common.

3.  The third grouping are WSUP-identified areas of interest either
    based on previous work locations or proposed future locations. These
    are even more localised areas and are often not clearly delineated
    geographically. This will require work to delineate and map these
    areas as clearly as possible so that they can server as third level
    sub-divisions with their own sampling frame.

    It should be noted that this third-level of sub-division will
    require additional sample size which should be considered weighing
    in the desirability of having results specific to WSUP-identified
    areas of interest with resources available.

Each of these levels of spatial stratification will have their own
sampling frames and as such will require their own sample sizes.

### Sample Size

The following sample size calculations are for each spatial strata
described above which will address WSUP’s requirements for spatially
disaggregated results based on defined sets of populations to report on.

**Sample size for estimating proportion-type indicators** Based on the
nature of the indicators that WSUP requires the survey to report on, the
sample size calculations should be powered to be able to report
proportion-type of estimates. In addition, sample size required for the
survey depends on:

1.  `Precision` of the estimate required (as determined by the width of
    the confidence interval around the estimates); and,

2.  `Variance inflating factor (VIF)` or `design effect (DEFF)` for the
    chosen design (e.g., simple random sample, cluster sample, etc.),
    reflecting the increase in sample required to use a cluster design.
    The general formula to calculate sample sizes to estimate a
    proportion (sometimes called prevalence) indicator is:

  

$$n = z^{2} \times \frac{p(1 - p)}{c^{2}}$$  

where

  

$n = \text{sample size}$

$z = \text{z-value for}\ 95\%\ \text{confidence interval}$

$p = \text{expected proportion/prevalence}$

$c = \text{level of precision}$

  

To be able to use this formula, we set out the following parameters
specific to the survey requirements and the sample frame described
above:

  

$z = 1.96\ \text{(for}\ 95\%\ \text{CI)}$

$p = 50\%\ \text{(assume proportion requiring highest sample size)}$

$c = 0.10\ \text{(}10\%\ \text{precision)}$

  

This gives us the following sample size:

  

$$n = 1.96^{2} \times \frac{0.5(1 - 0.5)}{0.1^{2}} \approx 96$$  

We therefore need a sample size of $n = 96$ assuming a simple random
sample survey design.

However, given that we will be using a clustered sample design, we need
to take into consideration design effect or `DEFF`. `DEFF` is related to
the indicators being studied as well as the planned sample size per
cluster, and is best calculated empirically from previous similar
surveys in the area being studied. The best reference survey to use to
estimate `DEFF` from is the **Demographic and Health Survey (DHS)**
which is conducted every 5 years in most countries. In general, DHS
includes an urban sample from the capital city and from other main
cities of the country which can be used to estimate the
`intra-cluster coefficient (ICC)`. The `intra-cluster coefficient` gives
an estimate of how correlated the responses are for specific questions /
indicators within a cluster thereby providing a metric for the loss of
variance as a function of the cluster survey sample design. The purpose
of `DEFF` is to inflate the base sample size based on a simple random
sample design so as to increase the variance of the survey sample. This
counteracts the clustering that happens with a cluster sample design and
that is created by the type of indicators being surveyed (such as water
and sanitation indicators). `DEFF` can be calculated using the following
formula:

  

$$DEFF = 1 + (c - 1) \times \rho$$  

where

  

$c = \text{cluster size}$

$\rho = \text{intracluster coefficient (ICC)}$

  

This equation shows that `DEFF` increases with increases in cluster size
and/or in `ICC`. Since there is very little we can do to change `ICC`,
the general idea will be to reduce cluster size as much as possible as
this will bring down `DEFF`. The smaller the cluster size, the more that
the survey design approximates a simple random sample.

Studies that have estimated `DEFF` using survey datasets from various
countries have shown that `DEFF` for water and sanitation indicators can
range from as low as 1.5 to as high as 7. `DEFF` should therefore be
estimated per country whenever possible so that a more precise sample
size estimate can be calculated.

Once `DEFF` has been estimated, the base sample size of $n = 96$ can be
adjusted as follows:

  

$$n_{adjusted} = n_{base} \times DEFF = 96 \times DEFF$$  

**Sample size for classifying proportion indicators** Another way of
reporting proportion indicators is by classification, that is
determining whether a certain threshold or thresholds is/are reached by
the results of the indicator enabling its categorisation into specific
classes of achievement (i.e., high or low, success or failure, adequate
or inadequate). The approach of classification is called
`lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)` which is an analytical technique
developed and used widely in the industrial field (pharmaceuticals,
manufacturing to name a few) as an efficient and cost-effective way of
checking and controlling the quality of voluminous products
manufactured[¹¹](#fn11). `LQAS` requires much smaller sample size than
the classical estimation approach mainly because of the type of
information it provides (classification rather than estimation). From a
quality control perspective particularly at an industrial level, a
classification result determining whether a specific lot or set of goods
produced are of good quality or not is just the information needed to be
able to make decisions on whether or not to release the lot of goods to
the market and whether an inspection of a specific production line needs
to be performed to check its manufacturing process. Such decision-making
do not require results of high precision. For example, if a drug company
sets its quality control standard at $80\%$ of medicine in a batch
produced meets the quality requirements, then a survey with a sample
size aimed at reporting an estimate with acceptable precision (as
described above) that gives an estimate of 60% has the same
decision-making value as a survey using a much smaller sample size
(usually $n = 40$) that classifies the batch of medicines as failure
(below $80\%$). Both sets of result will guide plant managers in
determining that the specific batch of medicines are of poor quality
hence should not be brought to market. However, the `LQAS` approach
provides this information with about half of the sample size.

The use of this quality control technique has been adapted for use in
health monitoring and health surveys, which include water and sanitation
indicators, to a great degree because of its small sample size
requirements[¹²](#fn12) which lends itself well to routine and repeated
applications over time and location.

`LQAS` generally requires a sample size of $n = 40$ . Adjustments to
this sample size are made based on survey design and the cut-offs used
for classifying with a cut-off of $50\%$ requiring the highest sample
size ($n = 40$). Factoring cluster design, this minimum sample size can
go up to $n = 60$ which is the typical sample size used for `LQAS`
applied to water and sanitation indicators[¹³](#fn13).

### Stage 1 sampling

Stage 1 sampling is the the selection of clusters or
`primary sampling units (PSU)` in which the sample of households will be
collected from. We propose to select survey clusters using a variable
grid spatial sampling approach. Cluster locations will be chosen for
each sampling frame (non-slum, slum, and operational area) using
`centric systematic area sampling (CSAS)`. This will be performed
through the following general steps[¹⁴](#fn14):

1.  Get appropriate maps for the city to be surveyed. The types of maps
    that will be appropriate for this urban sampling approach are:

    1.  Map data files[¹⁵](#fn15) that delineate the boundaries of the
        whole city and each of the three levels of the sampling
        frame[¹⁶](#fn16);

    2.  High resolution gridded population maps[¹⁷](#fn17); and,

    3.  Map data on roads, buildings, residential areas, landuse and
        places of interest for the city[¹⁸](#fn18).

2.  Using maps with boundaries of the different administrative levels
    with an overlay of the high resolution gridded population maps, draw
    a square grid around each spatial strata that has been identified
    for the city. The size of the grid will be dependent on the number
    of sampling clusters that has been decided when calculating sample
    size. The grid should cover only areas with populations as indicated
    by the population maps.

3.  Get the centroid of each quadrat (square) of the grid. This
    identifies the primary sampling unit within the specified area where
    the stage 2 sampling will be conducted. The geographical coordinates
    of the centroid will be captured and recorded and put on the stage 1
    sampling list (and drawn on appropriate maps) for enumerators to use
    during data collection.

It should be noted that the stage 1 sample is not selected
`proportional to population size (PPS)` which is a stage 1 sample
selection approach that is commonly used in most population surveys.
Instead the stage 1 sample is drawn spatially through an even square
grid across the city. This approach addresses the limitation of a `PPS`
sample which gives a cluster with higher population a higher probability
of being included in the sample compared to clusters with smaller
populations. Also, a population-weighted stage 1 sample is drawn from a
specific sampling frame hence can only be representative of that frame.
Any form of disaggregation of that dataset to provide results at finer
resolution will not be possible to perform.

For the spatial sampling approach, the dataset can be disaggregated and
aggregated accordingly by just applying a cluster weighting approach
(using the population at each cluster as the weights) used in analysis
of stratified data in estimating the indicators of interest. This is
what is called posterior weighting approach. Population estimates
obtained from WorldPop remote sensing data can be used for the purpose
of weighting the cluster data.

### Sampling Stage 2

At each cluster, a total of two households will be selected. The cluster
will be identified using GPS coordinates on enumerators’ devices, and
the start household will be identified as the building closest to the
GPS coordinates. In the case of a multi-household or apartment building,
the household will be chosen randomly. To select the second household,
we recommend a general approach of choosing from the building or housing
structure five doors to the right facing the door of the start
household.

It is very likely that the spatial organisation of the various cities to
be sampled will be different between each other. Also, within each city,
there will be differences in the setting and organisation of buildings
and houses in different parts of the city which will require adjustments
or variations to the general approach for stage 2 sampling described
above specifically for selecting the second household. This is something
that will require investigation and testing prior to the start of the
survey in every city and experiences documented in the process document
produced during and after the survey process. This will help in
producing more nuanced guidelines on other approaches to stage 2
sampling.

    Systematic Area Sampling (CSAS) method providing better spatial
    resolution with lower sampling costs. S3M is appropriate for mapping
    coverage (or prevalence of indicators) over very wide-areas.
    **SQUEAC** is a semi-quantitative method that provides in-depth
    analysis of barriers and boosters to coverage. It is designed as a
    routine program monitoring tool through the intelligent use of
    routine monitoring data complemented by other relevant data that are
    collected on a “little and often” basis. **SLEAC** is a rapid
    low-resource survey method that classifies coverage at the service
    delivery unit (SDU) level such as the district. A SLEAC survey
    identifies the category of coverage (e.g. “low coverage”, “moderate
    coverage” or “high coverage”) that describes the coverage of the
    service delivery unit being assessed. The advantage of this approach
    is that relatively small sample sizes (e.g. $n \leq 40$) are
    required in order to make an accurate and reliable classification.

4.  Bangladesh, Ghana, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique and Zambia

5.  Main consideration for selecting population of interest is living in
    areas within the city where WSUP is currently providing
    interventions or supporting projects

6.  It is interesting to note that based on the WSUP questionnaires,
    pregnant women are identified separately but are classified within
    the grouping of those with disability

7.  The questionnaire uses a 4 category scale i.e., satisfied, somewhat
    satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, dissatisfied

8.  WSUP uses the Progress out of Poverty Index (PPI)

9.  In some cities, these settlements are categorised or named as slums
    or squatters areas and can be formally or informally recognised by
    authorities and/or city planners

10. Especially true if the mapping of the low-income/poor areas are
    fixed specifically on administrative boundaries and not at more
    localised areas

    LQAS on reporting water and sanitation indicators recommended by the
    Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP)

14. Some modifications to these steps may need to be done on a country
    by country basis particularly with regard to how the groupings of
    the spatial units are organised and sub-divided. Otherwise, the
    general approach is the same on any setting.

15. There are many formats for map files. In general, the most common
    and most accessible formats are keyhole markup language (KML) files
    which are the standard output format produced by Google Maps/Google
    Earth and ESRI Shapefiles.

16. These days,there are various available online repositories of map
    data files for most countries including cities. We most commonly use
    the repository maintained by Robert Hijmans at <https://gadm.org>
    and the one maintained by UN OCHA called Humanitarian Data Exchange
    (<https://data.humdata.org>). Organisations such as the World Food
    Programme also maintain their own repositories but most of their
    maps are also made available through the Humanitarian Data Exchange.

17. The best openly available sources for this map data are from the
    [WorldPop project](https://www.worldpop.org) and the [Global
    Rural-Urban Mapping Project or
    GRUMP](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/catalog/sedac-ciesin-sedac-grumpv1-ext-1.00).

18. For most cities,this can be available from OpenStreetMap or OSM
    (<https://www.openstreetmap.org>). Google Earth can also be used to
    view satellite imagery of the city.
