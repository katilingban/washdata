# washdata: Urban Water and Sanitation Survey Dataset

This package contains four datasets from an urban water and sanitation
survey in Dhaka, Bangladesh conducted by [Water and Sanitation for the
Urban Poor](https://wsup.com) with technical support from [Valid
International](http://www.validinternational.org) in March 2017.

- `popBGD`: Dataset on estimated population of each primary sampling
  unit (PSU) that were surveyed. This dataset is a mix of data from
  [WorldPop](https://www.worldpop.org) for the non-slum areas and from
  the [2014 Bangladesh Census of Slum Areas and Floating
  Population](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01wm117r42q).

- `ppiMatrixBGD`: Look-up table for calculating the
  `Poverty Probability Index` (previously called
  `Progress out of Poverty Index`) or `PPI` from Bangladesh-specific
  indicators collected from cross-sectional surveys. This look-up table
  is extracted from documentation of the `PPI` found at
  <https://www.povertyindex.org>

- `surveyDataBGD`: Dataset collected through the urban water and
  sanitation surveys conducted by WSUP in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

- `indicatorsDataBGD`: Dataset produced from `surveyDataBGD` by
  calculating relevant indicators on water, sanitation and hygiene as
  specified and defined by WSUP

This survey in Dhaka is one of a series of surveys to be conducted by
WSUP in various cities in which they operate including Accra, Ghana;
Nakuru, Kenya; Antananarivo, Madagascar; Maputo, Mozambique; and,
Lusaka, Zambia. This package will be updated once the surveys in other
cities are completed and datasets have been made available.
